# ML_Hello_World_81
Digit Recognition, 81% accuracy

I am using 2 layers here, and even though the accuracy is 81% i actually achieved 85% with a single layer(I know, crazy), however this is more of a 'proof of concept' that I can work with multiple hidden layers, instead of me just trying to maximise the accuracy.

Before running the code, please run "generate_mnist_csv.py" in "MNIST_ORG" folder

terminal:
**python MNIST_ORG/generate_mnist_csv.py**

Then run the code blocks one by one, tweak as you wish, although I guarantee you that it will be hectic.
